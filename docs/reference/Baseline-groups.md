# Baseline Groups

Launchpad includes the following groups in its Baseline that can be used as
loading targets:

- `Deployment` will load all the packages needed in a deployed application
- `Examples` will load two example applications
- `Tests` will load the test cases
- `CI` is the group loaded in the continuous integration setup, in this
  particular case it is the same as `Tests`
- `Dependent-SUnit-Extensions` will load extensions to SUnit
- `Development` will load all the needed packages to develop and contribute to
  the project
